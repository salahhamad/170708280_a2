    Cookies are any information received from a website such as images and files,
     which is then downloaded to a storage location on your computed called browser cache.
      This information basically acts as a copy of a website to speed up loading times.
      Clearing the browser cache removes all the stored data from websites visited,
      and essentially making the browser think that you are visiting a website for the first
       time in which then the computer downloads the website cache once again.
        MailChimp forms are cookies, meaning that this information is stored. For this part of
         the assignment, closing the popup form once makes the popup not pop up again as the
          browser records our activity to limit how many times we see the popup. Clearing the
           cache allowed for successful testing as it allows the creator to see the form as if they
            were visiting the site for the first time.
